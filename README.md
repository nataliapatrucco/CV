## 📌 About me

I have a degree in Business Administration and I have experience as an entrepreneur, in advertising and a few more markets.

At the beginning of 2019, I decided to take a major turn in my life and started studying programming. I enrolled in an intensive Coding Bootcamp where I learned about the latest technologies as well as teamwork and the agile methodologies.

In January I started working at Globant and so far I have been part of two projects where I keep learning new things and improving my skills every day.

I have experience working with the following tech stack / tools:

React.js
Javascript / TypeScript
CSS/Sass
Atomic Design
Socket.io
Microsoft Azure
Git
Visual Studio
Styled Components
SPA
Webpack
Agile Methodologies - SCRUM

I would like to work in a collaborative environment where I can contribute to the team and keep adding new skills.

Nationality: Italy & Argentina.
