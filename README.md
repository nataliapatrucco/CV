### _**About me**_

I have a degree in Business Administration and have worked in very diverse environments, I have experience as an entrepreneur, in advertising and a few more markets.
In the beginning of 2019 I decided to take a major turn in my life and started studying programming. I soon began to get more exited to be able to do so many new things and I finally enrolled in a intensive Coding Bootcamp. There I learned the trendiest technologies as well as the team work and the agile methodologies.
In January I started working in Globant and so far I have been part of two projects where I keep getting better and learning new things every day.
I`d like to be part of a collaborative environment where everyone´s opinion is heard.
I am ready for the next challenge in my career, planning to move to the Nethearlands (no sponsorship needed) and land my dream job.
